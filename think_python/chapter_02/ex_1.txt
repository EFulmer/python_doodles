Exercise 2.1.  If you type an integer with a leading zero, you might get a 
confusing error:

>>> zipcode = 02492
                  ^
SyntaxError: invalid token

Other numbers seem to work, but the results are bizarre:
>>> zipcode = 02132
>>> zipcode
1114

Can you figure out what is going on? Hint: display the values 01, 010, 0100 
and 01000.


Answer: 

>>> 01
1
>>> 010
8
>>> 0100
64
>>> 01000
512

These are all numbers in base 8! This is why an integer with a leading zero 
will cause an error when it includes a 9 somewhere in it. 9 is not a valid 
digit for base 8 numbers.
