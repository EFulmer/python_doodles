Exercise 1.4.  
Start the Python interpreter and use it as a calculator. Python's syntax for 
math operations is almost the same as standard mathematical notation. For 
example, the symbols +, -, and / denote addition, subtraction, and division, 
as you would expect. The symbol for multiplication is *.

If you run a 10 kilometer race in 43 minutes 30 seconds, what is your average 
time per mile? What is your average speed in miles per hour? (Hint: there are 
1.61 kilometers in a mile).



First, convert kilometers to miles. One kilometer is 1 / 1.61 miles, so ten 
kilometers is (1 / 1.61) * 10 miles, or 10 / 1.61 miles.

>>> 10 / 1.61
6.211180124223602

Next, we want average time per mile, or total time divided by total distance, 
but in miles as the question specifies.

>>> 43.5 / (10 / 1.61)
7.003500000000001

Finally, we want average speed, in miles per hour. Miles per hour is just 
another way of saying miles divided by time in hours, so we convert 43 minutes 
and 30 seconds into a decimal (43.5, since 30 seconds is 0.5 minutes), and 
then divide that by 60 to get 43.5 minutes in hours.

>>> (10 / 1.61) / (43.5 / 60)
